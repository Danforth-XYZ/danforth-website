# Danforth Enterprises Website

This is a professional, mobile-friendly website for Danforth Enterprises, built with Bootstrap and ready for free hosting on GitHub Pages.

## How to Publish on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub repository** (e.g., `danforthxyz.github.io`).
2. **Add these files** to your repository: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `main.js`, and `README.md`.
3. **Commit and push** all files to the `main` branch.
4. On GitHub, go to **Settings > Pages** and ensure the source is set to the `main` branch (`/root` for folder).
5. Your site will be live at `https://your-github-username.github.io/`.

- All styling is in `styles.css` and you can tweak colors or layout as needed.
- The logo is embedded as SVG in the navbar and as a favicon.
- The contact form is static (no backend). For a working form, connect it to a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms.
